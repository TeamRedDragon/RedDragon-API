The common API toolkit for all RedDragon mods:
* [RedDragon Gorgeous Greens](https://github.com/TeamRedDragon/RedDragon-Gorgeous-Greens) (ðŸš§ concept stage)
* [RedDragon Nutritious Noms](https://github.com/TeamRedDragon/RedDragon-Nutritious-Noms)
* [RedDragon Food Factory](https://github.com/TeamRedDragon/RedDragon-Food-Factory) (ðŸš§ concept stage)
* [RedDragon Marvelous Machines](https://github.com/TeamRedDragon/RedDragon-Marvelous-Machines)

**You don't need to download or install this API. It will be automatically shipped with any release of our mods.**

If you're a mod developer, you are allowed and encouraged to use this API. It provides some low-level features we abstracted away from our content-focussed mods during development. That includes:
* Easily adding new blocks, items and fluids
* Utils methods for easy fluid setup
* Framework for self-drying fluid blocks
