The common API toolkit for all RedDragon mods.

**You don't need to download or install this API. It will be automatically shipped with any release of our mods.**

If you're a mod developer, you are allowed and encouraged to use this API though. It provides high-level features we missed during development and collected as this standalone API. That includes:
* Easily adding new blocks, items and fluids
* Utils methods for easy fluid setup
* Framework for self-drying fluid blocks
